This Project is to predict the success of Bank Telemarketing using ML models. 

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

The metric used to evaluate was "f1_macro". The score obtained is 0.78110 on final submission in Kaggle.
